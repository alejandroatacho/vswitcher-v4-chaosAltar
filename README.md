# V4 Chaos Altar - Auto Bones Use On Altar Script

## Overview
This script is designed to automate the process of using bones on the Chaos Altar in the game. It checks if you are at the Chaos Altar, and if so, it uses the specified type of bones on the altar automatically. This script can be useful for players who want to quickly convert bones into prayer exp without manually clicking on the altar each time.

## How to Use
1. **User Variables**: In the script, you'll find a section labeled "User Variables". Here, you can customize the script behavior by setting the `bones` variable to the ID of the bone type you want to use on the Chaos Altar.

2. **Running the Script**: Once you've set the desired bone ID, run the script.
